SQLServer is more convenient than running locally in that it saves local storage and computation power and store and execute all documents in cloud. This enables me to collaborate with other people without having to grant them access to my computer. During the completion of this homework, I have never encountered any bugs from the system, and I can access the database from anywhere. However, I have found that the execution and importing time is longer than in local environment. I guess that is due to the network delay, or simply that my Azure database server is weaker than my personal computer. Anyway, when dealing with enormous amount of data or working in group, computing in cloud is much more efficient. I will recommend SQLServer to future co-workers for their project, if I had a chance.
